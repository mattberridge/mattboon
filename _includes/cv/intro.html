      I’m a freelance <strong>front end developer</strong> based in Berlin with a background in modular CSS architecture, but who <strong>writes mostly JavaScript</strong> these days. I've also got a pretty good eye for design both on and off the web.

      Recently I’ve been working on a split-stack website for a German artist built in React, Redux and HAPI, using Craft CMS to manage an archive of artworks provided via JSON API.

      I’d be especially excited to work with you on music or lifestyle orientated projects, as away from the web you’ll find me collecting and playing records, running or riding my bike.
