      I’m a freelance <strong>front end developer</strong> based in Berlin with a background in modular CSS architecture, but who <strong>writes mostly JavaScript</strong> these days. I've also got a pretty good eye for design both on and off the web.

      Recently I’ve been working on the interface for a cloud storage application built using React and Redux, including creating a component library using Fela and Storybook.

      I’d be especially excited to work with you on music or lifestyle orientated projects, as away from the web you’ll find me collecting and playing records, running or riding my bike.
